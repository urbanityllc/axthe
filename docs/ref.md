- You can, and often do, make a call to dynamically get a list of the static files, pages or content you have in a folder! This is often used with pug template mixins. Here is how to enable that:
```
npm i axthe
```
This is the specil part of the static files approach aka Jamstack: that it can be/is dynamic, just happens to be file centric. You can and still and do use a DB in addition to static files, but Jamstack is a static file approach, so you'll have to learn the static file approach.
