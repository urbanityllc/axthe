<i>AXthe tech stack is <b>A</b>n opinionated e<b>X</b>press.js and <b>T</b>emplating <b>HE</b>lper for high productivity webapp development</i>
 
It offers two development environments, first the above mentioned SSR-first with REST API development; and a second CORS-only for pure native mobile(/Cordova) and/or pure CDN edge deployment(aka Jamstack), leveraging plain webcomponents and the REST APIs from SSR. So both SSR and JAM stack are supported in separate but productive development environments.
